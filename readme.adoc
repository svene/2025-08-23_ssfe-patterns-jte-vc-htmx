Spring Boot App with patterns on how to use JTE and View Components with JTE

== Usage

- Start Application
- Point browser to: http://localhost:8080/ which should display the Main Page
- Each Demo of the Main page shows a specific pattern

== Further Info

- https://github.com/tschuehly/spring-view-component

NOTE: JTE does not allow unclosed tags.

== TODO

- OOB usage
- events usage: `HtmxResponseUtils.setHxTrigger(response, SomeComponent.EVENT_URL_CHANGED);`
- keep frontendstate in hidden input fields ?

== Notes

simple jte:
- in controller you always have to return exact path to JTE.
With VC it is implicit
- Use URL constants for Controller-View Components
